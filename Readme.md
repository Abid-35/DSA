# 📘 DSA Learning Journey with Java

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository!  
This repository documents my learning and practice in DSA using Java.  
🚀 Started my journey recently and here is what I’ve covered in the first 2 days:

## ✅ What I’ve Learned So Far:

### 📌 Day 1: Introduction to DSA & Time Complexity
- Understood the **importance of DSA** in solving real-world problems efficiently.
- Learned about **Time Complexity** and **Big-O Notation**:
  - Best, Worst, and Average Cases.
  - Common complexities: O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²).
  - How to analyze time complexity from code.

### 📌 Day 2: Searching Algorithms
#### 🔍 Linear Search
- Used when the array is **unsorted**.
- Iterates over each element.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**

#### 🔎 Binary Search (Recursive & Iterative)
- Works only for **sorted arrays**.
- Divides the array in half repeatedly.
- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**


### 📌 Day 3:Types of Sorting
-Bubble Sort , Selection Sort.
-Their time complexity is o(n^2)i.e Quadratic.
