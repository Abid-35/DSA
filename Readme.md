# 📘 DSA Learning Journey with Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repo documents my DSA learning and hands-on practice using **Java**.  
🚀 I’ve completed over 5 days of consistent progress—here’s a quick overview:

---

## ✅ What I’ve Learned So Far

### 📌 Day 1: Introduction to DSA & Time Complexity
- Importance of DSA for solving problems efficiently.
- Learned **Big-O Notation**: `O(1)`, `O(n)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n²)`
- Analyzing code for best, worst, and average cases.

---

### 📌 Day 2: Searching Algorithms

#### 🔍 Linear Search
- For **unsorted arrays**, checks each element.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

#### 🔎 Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)
- For **sorted arrays**, divides search space in half.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`

---

### 📌 Day 3: Sorting Algorithms (Part 1)
- **Bubble Sort:** Swap adjacent if in wrong order — `O(n²)`
- **Selection Sort:** Select min & place at start — `O(n²)`
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds sorted array gradually — `O(n²)`  
> ✅ Suitable for small datasets.

---

### 📌 Day 4: Sorting Algorithms (Part 2)

#### ⚡ Quick Sort
- **Divide and Conquer**, uses pivot to partition.
- **Avg Time:** `O(n log n)` | **Worst:** `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` (recursive)

---

### 📌 Day 5: Sorting Algorithms (Part 3)

#### 🧩 Merge Sort
- Recursively splits and merges halves.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` (all cases)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
- ✅ Stable and consistent

### 📌 Day 6: Linked List
- The data structure is same as Abstract Data Structure.
- Doesn’t work with index value. If you try to access with an index value, it will track between the elements.
- It is time-consuming.
