# 📘 DSA Learning Journey with Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repository documents my learning and hands-on practice in DSA using **Java**.  
🚀 I recently started this journey, and here’s what I’ve covered in the first 5 days:

---

## ✅ What I’ve Learned So Far

### 📌 Day 1: Introduction to DSA & Time Complexity
- Understood the **importance of DSA** in solving real-world problems efficiently.
- Learned about **Time Complexity** and **Big-O Notation**:
  - Best, Worst, and Average cases.
  - Common complexities: `O(1)`, `O(n)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n²)`.
  - How to analyze time complexity from code.

---

### 📌 Day 2: Searching Algorithms

#### 🔍 Linear Search
- Used when the array is **unsorted**.
- Iterates through each element.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

#### 🔎 Binary Search (Recursive & Iterative)
- Used only for **sorted arrays**.
- Continuously divides the array in half.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`

---

### 📌 Day 3: Sorting Algorithms (Part 1)

#### 🟢 Bubble Sort
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they’re in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`

#### 🟢 Selection Sort
- Repeatedly selects the minimum element and places it at the beginning.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`

#### 🟢 Insertion Sort
- Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`

> 📝 All three are **quadratic time** sorting algorithms and work best for small datasets.

---

### 📌 Day 4: Sorting Algorithms (Part 2)

#### ⚡ Quick Sort
- Uses the **Divide and Conquer** strategy.
- Picks a pivot and partitions the array.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Average Case: `O(n log n)`
  - Worst Case (e.g., already sorted input + bad pivot): `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` (due to recursion stack)

---

### 📌 Day 5: Sorting Algorithms (Part 3)

#### 🧩 Merge Sort
- Also follows the **Divide and Conquer** strategy.
- Divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges the result.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` in all cases (best, average, and worst)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (uses extra space for temporary arrays)
- A **stable sort** — preferred when stability is needed or when consistent performance is important.

### 📌 Day 6: Sorting Algorithms (Part 3)

### LInked List
- The Data structure is same as Abstract Data Structure doesn't work with index value . If you try to acces with index vlaue it will track btw the elements .IT is time consuming
